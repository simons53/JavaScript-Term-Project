                <p>Mew (Japanese: ミュウ Mew) is a Psychic-type Mythical Pokémon introduced in Generation I.</p> 
                <p>It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.</p> 
                <p>Mew is notable for its unique ability to learn every Technical Machine, Technical Record, Hidden Machine, and Move Tutor move (except those exclusive to a particular Pokémon or group of Pokémon, such as Volt Tackle and Secret Sword).</p> 
                <p>It is associated with Mewtwo, and thus they are collectively referred to as the Mew duo by fans.</p>
                <p>Mew was first officially revealed in the May 1996 issue of CoroCoro,[1] less than two months after Pokémon Red and Green were released in Japan.</p>

                <p>This Pokémon lives in dark places untouched by sunlight. When it appears before humans, it hides itself under a cloth that resembles a Pikachu.</p>
