POKE-GUESS - GAME DIRECTIONS
-------------------------
Poke-Guess is a Pokemon themed guessing game where the player must guess the name, type, and generation of the Pokemon shown.

Refer to the chart on the right to guess the type of the Pokemon. Then guess the name and generation of the Pokemon. You will not be permitted to go to the next round until you guess correctly. 

No issues currently. 

Will potentially add more Pokemon to the guessing game. Could use API for easier time.
