PAC-EMON - GAME DIRECTIONS
-------------------------
Pac-emon is a Pokemon themed game that takes after the game Pac-Man. 

Use your arrow keys to move Pikachu and avoid Team Rocket's Pokeballs. Power pellets allow you to capture the Pokeballs, but only while they are blue!

No issues currently.

May add future levels with different Pokemon as the playable character.
